hello world
this is my first blog post, citrinitas.
citrinitas is the only proper synonym of the best word ever, xanthosis.
as you probably know, xanothosis was the 1995 Scripps National Spelling Bee winning word, as well as the word Akeelah intentionally spelled wrong in Akeelah and the Bee
citrinas is an acronym for inartistic, which is Finnish is ep√§taiteellinen. that word sort of looks like epithelium.
don't forget to moisturize and cleanse!
